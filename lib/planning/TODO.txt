PACKAGE NOTES

Once I've done these, I have to look into testing the package
- First, try a dry-run for publishing to make sure it's ready in that regard (dart pub publish --dry-run)
! You can publish a package as a prerelease: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/publishing#publishing-prereleases
! Once a package is published, it will ALWAYS remain so (don't publish until you're confident). 
You can mark a package as discontinued though.

- I'll probably just make a test example main.dart file for using the creator widget; 
e.g. the provider package HAS no main.dart but it DOES have one under the examples folder

DOCUMENT THOROUGHLY before publishing
