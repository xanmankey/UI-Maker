- Takes a layout as input
- Uses the layout.numGroups property to get a list of numGroups lists of widgets

CREATOR_BASE TODO
- If I could check if a child has changed/been rebuilt, I could update the settings here
- This would reduce database calls, but I'm not sure how to check that

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
- Does the details value in onAcceptWithDetails allow me 
to access or write an instance of WidgetSettings? It doesn't seem like it...

TODO
- onAcceptWithDetails
- onMove


CREATOR_WIDGETS TODO
- Implement draggable with them (or perhaps re-impement creator base; might 
work better here)
