- Finish implementing the sortWidgets() method (and figure out where to call it)
- Keep implementing context menu (and adapt other widgets as well)
- Implement main.dart

- TEST (write tests and try it with DWTP)
- Figure out how to publish a package and use it for my CS project (https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages)

MY MAIN GOAL:
Create a system where a widget can be dragged in, custom properties can be defined,
and you can sort by those properties to either order or filter widgets
ALL WITHOUT allowing the user to change the database structure and maintaining layout for next time

SUBGOALS:
Make it as easy to develop new 'Creator' widgets as possible
Satisfy pub dev points requirements
