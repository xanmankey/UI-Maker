Right now there's a number of problems I need to tackle: 
- Widget display. This is my number one priority
- DropdownItemCreator Dialog breaks
- Sorting and other layouts haven't been tested, I don't think filtering has even been implemented in UI


FUTURE GOALS
- Tests

Reworking creatorScaffold + generateLayout to offer optional write functionality

BRAINSTORMING

My NUMBER ONE goal right now is to somehow allow for a CreatorWidget where you can simply and easily
define your initial drag state for a widget and your dropped state of a widget that's intuitive and 
easy to elaborate upon. This is the HEART of the app, something my data would be shaped around.

I kind of already have this w/ CreatorBase... perhaps CreatorCard, CreatorCheckbox, etc shouldn't 
be directly wrapped in CreatorBase... perhaps they should just be widgets for creation? That 
would allow for more flexibility anyhow...

I think I'd like to make that change to the CreatorWidgets; and then I also think some kind of a database 
change needs to be considered. It's not ideal as it currently is, it's complex and unintuitive.
(this goes for my database wrapper as well; it's fairly limited, so I wonder if there's a better way to handle this?)
(I need to examine it all...)
