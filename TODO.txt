- Once I'm SATISFIED with testing and how the package works, 
THEN I'll start copying and going into greater detail for documentation

CURRENT PROBLEM
- My new understanding about pumping; PUMP ONE WIDGET AT A TIME 
(in flutter, changes in state occur, so if you pump a lot you would need to repump 
to offset these changes anyway, so there's no point in pumping extra widgets)

(almost) NO POINT IN DEBUGGING VIA FLUTTER RUN until I've written and ran successful tests

// I would love a generative testing framework as well;
// What if I could create test cases for each widget?

I think I'm going to move away from native_context_menus; 
I'm going to try to do my own implementation using contextMenuBuilder
