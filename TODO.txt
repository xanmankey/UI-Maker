CURRENT PROBLEM
- The finder "zero widgets with widget matching predicate (Closure: (Widget) => bool) that has
ancestor(s) with type "ListTile" (ignoring offstage widgets)" (used in a call to "tap()") could not
find any matching widgets.
(I need to rework context menu selection apparently)

I changed to pumpAndSettle and some things changed

NOTE that my widget tests are DIFFERENT than integration tests (see more about that here: https://docs.flutter.dev/testing#integration-tests)
TODO: I'm not sure the context menu is actually opening

I like the idea of lots of expect statements to ensure that everything is working as intended
In order to visualize widgetTree, you can just log using debugDumpApp() or perhaps tester.allWidgets.toString()

It seems like you can potentially run `flutter run -t my_test.dart' to visualize your test on a simulator in addition to running it
(but it will only render the final outcome; that's why you want to break your tests into even smaller pieces)

Right now I think the best way to go about things is to root out the problems visually if I can; I can't 
work with the tests in an effective way right now because of some of the logic errors, but if I can get 
those I should be able to move forward with the tests (not TDD unfortunately though)

MY GOAL is to test and rewrite to get the visual test working so I can start working on the behind the scenes tests
I guess I'll work on creator_bar, scaffold, etc tmrs

Once I'm done writing my tests I'm going to do some tests of my own by using my library to make DWTP

I got a lot done, but I'm not sure why the Drag and Drop isn't triggering ANYTHING in the CreatorArea (that's a little concerning, as it 
is a core part of my library functionality)
