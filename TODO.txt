- Once I'm SATISFIED with testing and how the package works, 
THEN I'll start copying and going into greater detail for documentation

CURRENT PROBLEM
- Creator area build error (ran all the way until this? I'll need to restructure my code I guess...)

(almost) NO POINT IN DEBUGGING VIA FLUTTER RUN until I've written and ran successful tests

I do need to rework the creator widgets to more fully incorporate the WidgetSettingsKeys enum

TOMMOROW my goal is to ACTUALLY start testing (hopefully); today was just prep

FIGURE OUT whether I'm using MapValues or widgets
