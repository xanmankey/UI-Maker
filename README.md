> Isn't flutter already a tool for building UIs?

Yes, in the same way that a game engine is a tool for building a game. The purpose of this package is to help make the process more accessible by enabling users to drag and drop widgets, easily sort by an index, and reorganize the UI as they see fit. This also gives app designers more freedom as they get to define specific areas (using the ```CreatorArea``` widget) where users can add their own widgets from a selection. 

## Q&A

> Can I add a widget to the CreatorBar widgets?

Yes, although only the provided widgets have been tested. Note that if you want right click functionality, you will need to wrap your widget with the ```CreatorContextMenu``` widget.
